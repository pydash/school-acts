Contains past activities in school that I just want to convert into actual coding.

1. Mark Daniel's Company -- House Design
   - His company needs a program that will get the order of their customers and compute total.

2. Internet Billing
   - An Internet Service Provider (ISP) has three different subscription packages. Compute bill according to package, month, and consumed hours.
